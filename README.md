# FPGA-Rubiks-Cube-State-Input
Touch Screen LCD quartus project for inputting the state of a Rubik's Cube for use in a Rubik's Cube solving robot. Designed for the Altera Max 10 DE10 Lite development board with an MSP2807 tft screen.

The screen has two spi controllers, one for the LCD, the other for the touch screen. The LCD uses an ILI9341, and the touch screen uses an XPT2046.

## Building
 - Clone project and open file in quartus and compile
 - Connect screen as shown in this table:

| Screen Pin | FPGA Pin | FPGA GPIO # |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| VCC        | 3.3V     | 29          |
| GND        | GND      | 30          |
| CS         | Y7       | 28          |
| RST        | AA8      | 27          |
| DC/RS      | AA9      | 25          |
| SDI (MOSI) | Y8       | 26          |
| SCK        | AB10     | 23          |
| LED        | AA10     | 24          |
| SDO (MISO) | AB11     | 21          |
| T_CLK      | W11      | 22          |
| T_CS       | AB12     | 19          |
| T_DIN      | Y11      | 20          |
| T_DO       | W12      | 17          |
| T_IRQ      | AB13     | 18          |


## Important Files:

The hierarchy for implementation files is as follows:
 - LCD_RUBIKS_CUBE_DISPLAY.sv
    - TOUCH_CALIBRATION.sv (Not in use)
    - COLOUR_CHOICE_LCD.sv
        - SQUARE_STATE.sv
        - SQUARE_TOUCH.sv
    - STEP_CONVERSTION.sv
    - RUBIKS_CUBE_STATE_LCD.sv
        - SQUARE_STATE.sv
    - LCD_SPI_CONTROLLER_RUBIK.sv
        - LCD_SPI_MASTER_IMPROVED.sv
    - RUBIKS_CUBE_STATE_TOUCH.sv
        - SQUARE_TOUCH.sv
    - TOUCH_SPI_CONTROLLER.sv
        - TOUCH_SPI_MASTER.sv

These files are where the logic is held, the rest of the files will generally be generated by quartus or as IP.

## Features

- Ability to select the colours of 48 out of the 54 squares on the Rubik's cube (The remaining 6 are the centre squares which are constant)
- Ability to calibrate the touch screen (not implemented in live version)
- Demonstration of 5 bit Rubik's Cube single move format to 6 bit dual move format conversion using dev board's switches and leds

## Testbenches

Testbenches are currently located someplace else and will be added later
